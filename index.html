          <h3>Hurricane Ida, a record breaking storm, swept through New York City on Sept. 1, leaving the city in shambles afterwards. N.Y. was almost immediately declared a major disaster area. At the federal level, FEMA workers and aid were swiftly sent in.</h3>

          <h3>Occurring during Gov. Kathy Hochul’s first week in office, the storm was a test of the government at all levels, and of the city’s preparedness. It also served as a wakeup call for storms in the future which, due to climate change, can only be assumed to follow a similar track as Ida.</h3>

          <p>Since the storm, the death toll from Hurricane Ida has reached 16 in New York. In the Northeast, at least 51 deaths were linked to Ida. 11 of the deaths in New York City were caused by basement apartment flooding.</p>

          <p> $27 million was pledged to undocumented people in the city who are not eligible for FEMA aid. This money will be distributed through grants among an established network of community outreach programs. Not-for-profits partnering with this program opened on Sept. 27.</p>

          <p> Initial estimates made by FEMA found that Hurricane Ida caused $75 to $100 million in damage to the New York City transit system after about 75 million gallons of water flooded the subways. A primary cause of this problem was the capacity of city sewer systems, not built to be able to take that much water, which caused them to overflow.</p>

          <p> Hurricane Ida broke rainfall records in New York City set just over one week earlier. The city saw rates of 3.15 inches of rain during a single hour at Central Park. Just 11 days earlier, a record breaking 1.94 inches of rain fell in the park, only to be broken by Hurricane Ida.</p>
